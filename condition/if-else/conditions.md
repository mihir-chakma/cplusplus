A C++ conditional statement redirects a program's flow to execute additional code. Conditional statement in C++ decide the direction of the flow of program execution. There are different conditional statements available in C++, which are give below:

### if statement
### if-else statement
### nested if statement
### if else-if statement
### switch statement
### jump statements


## Jump Statements

There are four types of jump statements in C++. 

- break
- continue
- goto 
- return

#### Disadvantages of goto statement:

- The goto statement gives the power to jump to any part of the program but makes the program's logic complex and tangled.
- In modern programming, goto statement is considered a harmful construct and a bad programming practice.
- The goto statement can be replaced in most C++ programs using break and continue statements.
